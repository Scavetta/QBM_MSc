This experiment examined the effects of different feed types on chick weight over a period of 6 weeks after birth.

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r summary}
chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>% # comment
  summarise(avg = mean(weight),
            stdev = sd(weight),
            n = n()) -> CWsummary
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
kable(CWsummary)
```

```{r}
datatable(CWsummary)
```


## Plots

```{r boxplots, fig.cap = 'A nice boxplot.'}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r meanSD, fig.cap = 'Dot plot with summary stats.'}
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.65) +
  geom_pointrange(data = CWsummary, aes(x = feed, 
                                        y = avg,
                                        ymin = avg - stdev,
                                        ymax = avg + stdev), col = "red")
```

## Inferential Statistics

The one-way ANOVA summary:

```{r ANOVA}
chick.lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
datatable(anova(chick.lm))
```

Tukeyâ€™s Post-hoc test:

```{r posthocTests}

chickPHT <- TukeyHSD(aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts))

datatable(chickPHT$feed)
```
